# Fun Calculator 🎉

Welcome to the **Fun Calculator**! This simple Python script performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two user-provided numbers. It's a great starting point for beginners learning Python or anyone who wants a quick and fun calculator! 😎

## Features ✨
- ➕ **Addition**: Adds two numbers.
- ➖ **Subtraction**: Subtracts the second number from the first.
- ✖️ **Multiplication**: Multiplies the two numbers.
- ➗ **Division**: Divides the first number by the second (watch out for division by zero! 🚨).

## How to Use 🚀
1. **Run the script** in a Python environment.
2. **Enter the first number** when prompted.
3. **Enter the second number** when prompted.
4. **View the results** of all four operations displayed in the console.

### Example:
```bash
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5

Results of your two numbers:
Sum: 15.0
Difference: 5.0
Product: 50.0
Quotient: 2.0
```

## Requirements 📋
- Python 3.x installed on your machine.

## Notes ⚠️
- The script uses `float()` to handle decimal numbers.
- Division by zero will cause an error (this version doesn't handle it—feel free to improve it! 😉).

## Future Improvements 🔧
- Add error handling for division by zero.
- Include more operations (e.g., exponentiation, modulus).
- Add a loop to allow multiple calculations without restarting the script.

Enjoy calculating! 🎉💻
